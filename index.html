                    How do I get my husband to stop going ‘Goblin Mode’ during sex?
                </p>
                <p>
                    TLDR; My husband says ‘Goblin Mode activated’ when we start to have sex, growls and acts like a
                    caveman, and then says ‘Goblin Mode off’ when we stop, and then pretends not to remember afterward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I really love my husband and he’s always been great in bed. But recently he’s been acting really
                    weird.
                    So, a couple of days ago, my son went on a rampage through our house and said he was in ‘Goblin
                    Mode’.
                    We didn’t really know what to do with him, so we sent him to live with my parents so he can go to a
                    special needs school. My husband a really great relationship with our son and loved him more than
                    anything. Naturally, he was upset when he had to leave. He’s an incredibly tough man, but this was
                    the
                    first time I’ve ever seen him cry. I think since then, he’s been a little emotionally unwell. I’ve
                    heard
                    him muttering, ‘Goblin’ repeatedly when he didn’t notice me, staring blankly into his food, and just
                    going alone by himself to do who knows what. I feel awful for him, but we both agreed that this was
                    for
                    the best. Last night, the day after our son went away, we decided to have sex to relieve our stress.
                    However, my husband said ‘Goblin Mode activated’, starting growling, and went wild having sex with
                    me.
                    Admittedly, it was some of the best and most experimental sex I’ve ever had, but I’m worried that
                    something might be going on with my husband. Any advice?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Edit: The problem isn’t the ‘Goblin Mode’, it’s that he could be ill
